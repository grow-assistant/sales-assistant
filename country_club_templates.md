Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf can act as a full club concierge, covering not just on-course ordering but also poolside service and streamlined to-go operations. We designed it to help you and your team serve members quickly and conveniently—without juggling multiple systems.

We're looking for 2–3 clubs to partner with in 2025 at no cost. One of our current partners, Pinetree Country Club, saw a 54% boost in F&B revenue by making orders simple and accessible for members.

If you're open to a quick chat, I'd love to see if [ClubName] could benefit in the same way. Feel free to let me know a good time to connect, and I can share references or more details tailored to your needs.

Hey [FirstName],

Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], I wanted to share how Swoop Golf’s concierge platform can elevate [ClubName]’s member experience—from on-course deliveries to poolside ordering. By streamlining order flow, we help clubs reduce wait times and boost F&B revenue.

Consider the success story of Pinetree Country Club: after implementing our platform, they saw a 54% increase in F&B sales and a 40% reduction in wait times. Golf Inc. reports that clubs utilizing digital ordering platforms typically experience a 20–40% increase in ancillary revenue, illustrating the profound impact this could have on your bottom line.

Would a quick 10-minute call on Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work to discuss? If not, I’m happy to find another time.
