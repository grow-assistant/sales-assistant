Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf is more than a single-course solution—it’s a scalable platform that can unify F&B operations across all courses in your portfolio. We handle beverage cart requests, snack-bar orders, and to-go pickups in one streamlined interface, reducing wait times and boosting revenue potential.

We’re looking for 2–3 management companies to partner with in 2025 at no cost. One of our current partners, Pinetree Country Club, saw a 54% boost in F&B revenue by making orders seamless during each round.

If you're open to a quick chat, I'd love to see how [ManagementCompanyName] could benefit in the same way across your operations. Let me know a good time to connect, and I can share references or more details tailored to your needs.
