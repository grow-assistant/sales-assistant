Hi [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf supports management companies by providing a unified on-course solution—coordinating beverage cart services, snack-bar orders, and to-go pickups across all properties in your portfolio. Our aim is to maximize efficiency and maintain a smooth pace of play, site by site.

We’re offering a no-cost partnership to 2–3 management companies in 2025, so we can align our platform to your real operational needs. For example, at Pinetree Country Club, we reduced average order times by 40%, boosting both revenue and guest satisfaction.

Would you be open to a quick call on how Swoop could assist [ManagementCompanyName] and its facilities? I’d be happy to walk you through our approach.

Cheers,
Ty
