Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], I wanted to share how Swoop Golf supports management companies by acting as a centralized ordering solution—coordinating beverage cart requests, snack-bar orders, and to-go services across multiple properties. We designed the platform to improve operational flow and keep golfers engaged.

At Pinetree Country Club, our approach reduced average order times by 40%. I’d love to explore how we could replicate that success for [ManagementCompanyName] at scale. Would you be open to a 10-minute call next week?
