Hey [firstname],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], I’d love to introduce Swoop Golf—a platform that enables members to effortlessly order food & beverages from their mobile devices. We’ve just elevated our offering into a full-service full-club concierge platform—managing on-course orders, poolside F&B, racquet-sport deliveries, and sophisticated to-go services.

We’re inviting 2–3 clubs to join us at no cost for 2025, to ensure we perfectly address the needs of top-tier properties. At Pinetree Country Club, this model reduced average order times by 40%, keeping members impressed and pace of play consistent.

Swoop will enhance your members’ experience and preserve the exclusivity they value. Let’s chat about how this might work for [company_short_name]?
