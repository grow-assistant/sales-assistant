Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], I wanted to share how Swoop Golf’s full-club concierge platform can streamline [ClubName]’s operations. From pickleball-court F&B delivery to poolside orders and to-go pickups, our solution caters to members’ every preference while maintaining the exclusivity your club is known for.

We're inviting 2–3 clubs to collaborate with us at no cost for 2025, customizing our approach to fit their unique needs. For example, at Pinetree Country Club, we increased F&B revenue by 54% and lowered wait times by 40%—results we believe [ClubName] could mirror.

Would a quick 10-minute call on Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work to discuss the potential? If another time is better, just let me know.
