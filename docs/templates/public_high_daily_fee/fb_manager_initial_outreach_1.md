Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf is more than a basic golf service—we’re an on-course ordering platform built to boost F&B revenue while delivering a top-tier experience. By centralizing beverage cart and snack-bar requests, we help you serve premium clientele quickly and efficiently.

We’re looking for 2–3 facilities to partner with at no cost in 2025. Pinetree Country Club, for example, saw a 54% boost in F&B revenue by making on-course orders simple and accessible.

If you’re open to a short call, I’d love to see if [FacilityName] could experience similar success. Let me know a good time to connect, and I can share references or more details tailored to your needs.
