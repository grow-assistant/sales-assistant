Hi [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf has become a complete on-course solution—handling beverage cart requests, snack-bar orders, and efficient to-go pickups. Our goal is to streamline F&B while ensuring golfers who pay a premium feel well-served and stay on pace.

We’re inviting 2–3 facilities to partner with us in 2025 at no cost, so we can fine-tune our system around your needs. For example, Pinetree Country Club reported a 40% drop in average order times after implementing Swoop, leading to smoother rounds and happier guests.

Would you be open to a brief call about how this could work for [FacilityName]? I’d be happy to provide details and next steps.

Cheers,
Ty
