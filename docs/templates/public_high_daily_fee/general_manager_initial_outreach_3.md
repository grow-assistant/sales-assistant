Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], I wanted to share how Swoop Golf’s on-course platform can elevate the player experience at [FacilityName]. By streamlining beverage cart orders and snack-bar deliveries, we help reduce wait times and boost F&B revenue—key factors for facilities charging premium rates.

Consider Pinetree Country Club: after adopting our platform, they saw a 54% increase in F&B sales and a 40% reduction in wait times. According to industry data, using digital ordering often results in a 20–40% bump in ancillary revenue, which can significantly impact your bottom line.

Would a 10-minute call on Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work to discuss? If not, I’m happy to arrange another time.
