Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf has evolved beyond a golf-only service into a user-friendly on-course ordering solution—managing beverage cart requests, snack-bar orders, and to-go pickups. Our goal is to optimize operations and keep golfers moving at a steady pace.

We’re inviting 2–3 facilities to join us at no cost for 2025, ensuring we meet the specific needs of those with a lower daily fee structure. For instance, at Pinetree Country Club, this approach helped reduce average order times by 40%, leading to happier players and fewer slowdowns.

Interested in a quick chat about how this could work for [FacilityName]? We’d love to show you how Swoop can enhance your guests’ experience and streamline your operation.

Cheers,
Ty
