Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf is more than a golf service—it’s an on-course ordering platform that makes it easy for you and your team to serve guests quickly. Whether they’re requesting the beverage cart or grabbing a snack-bar order, we centralize everything so you don’t have to juggle multiple systems.

We’re looking for 2–3 facilities to partner with in 2025 at no cost. One of our current partners, Pinetree Country Club, saw a 54% boost in F&B revenue by streamlining orders and making it simple for players to purchase during their round.

If you’re open to a short chat, I’d love to see if [FacilityName] could benefit similarly. Let me know a good time to connect.
