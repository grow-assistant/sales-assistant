Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], I wanted to share how Swoop Golf’s on-course ordering platform can simplify operations at [FacilityName]. From beverage cart requests to snack-bar orders and to-go pickups, everything is centralized to help lower-fee facilities maintain quality service without overburdening staff.

We’re inviting 2–3 operations to partner with us at no cost for 2025 to customize our platform for their specific needs. For example, at Pinetree Country Club, F&B revenue jumped 54% and wait times dropped 40%—results we think [FacilityName] could replicate.

Would a short call on Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work to explore this further? If those times aren’t ideal, feel free to suggest another.
