Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], I wanted to share how Swoop Golf now operates as a complete on-course solution—covering beverage cart requests, snack-bar orders, and to-go pickups. We’ve designed it specifically to help facilities with lower green fees run more efficiently and keep golfers content.

At Pinetree Country Club, our platform lowered average order times by 40%, minimizing backups and keeping players engaged. I’d love to discuss how we could help [FacilityName] achieve similar results. Would a 10-minute call next week work for you?
