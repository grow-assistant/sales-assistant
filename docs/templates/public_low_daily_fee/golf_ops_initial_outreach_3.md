Hi [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf provides a fully integrated approach to on-course service—taking care of beverage cart orders, snack-bar requests, and to-go pickups. We focus on improving operational flow so you can keep your golfers satisfied, even at a more budget-friendly price point.

We’re offering 2–3 facilities a no-cost partnership for 2025 to ensure our platform meets real-world needs. For instance, at Pinetree Country Club, we helped cut average order times by 40%, boosting overall golfer satisfaction.

Would you be open to a quick conversation on how this could work for [FacilityName]? I’d be happy to walk you through the details.
