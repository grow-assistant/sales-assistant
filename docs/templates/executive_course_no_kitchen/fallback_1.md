Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf is a streamlined ordering solution that handles beverage cart requests, simple snack-bar orders, and to-go pickups. We understand that with no full kitchen on-site, quick and convenient service is essential—so golfers can grab what they need and keep playing.

We’re inviting 2–3 executive courses to join us at no cost for 2025, ensuring our platform meets the unique needs of smaller operations. For instance, at Pinetree Country Club, average order times dropped by 40%, leading to happier golfers and less congestion.

Interested in a short chat about how Swoop might benefit [FacilityName]? We’d love to show you how we can make a limited-menu setup work smoothly for everyone.

Cheers,
Ty
