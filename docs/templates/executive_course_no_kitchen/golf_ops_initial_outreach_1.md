Hi [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf has been adapted for executive courses without a full kitchen—organizing beverage cart orders, snack-bar requests, and to-go pickups all in one place. This helps you maintain a smooth pace of play while still offering essential F&B options.

We’re inviting 2–3 facilities to join us at no cost for 2025, ensuring we align our platform to your specific needs. At Pinetree Country Club, this approach dropped average order times by 40%, keeping golfers happy and on schedule.

Interested in a quick chat on how this might work for [FacilityName]? We’d love to share how Swoop can make limited F&B options work effectively.

Cheers,
Ty
