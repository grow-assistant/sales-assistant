Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], I wanted to share how Swoop Golf accommodates courses with limited food-service setups—managing beverage cart requests, grab-and-go snack orders, and quick to-go services. By simplifying the process, you can still offer a top-notch experience without the demands of a full kitchen.

At Pinetree Country Club, our platform lowered average order times by 40%, helping maintain a smooth pace. I’d love to discuss how Swoop could adapt to [FacilityName]’s specific constraints. Would a 10-minute call next week work for you?

Cheers,
Ty
