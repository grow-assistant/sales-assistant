Hi [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf has evolved to address the specific needs of executive courses—coordinating basic F&B services like beverage carts and grab-and-go snacks without the complexities of a full kitchen. Our mission is to keep play flowing and your guests satisfied.

We’re extending a no-cost partnership to 2–3 courses in 2025, ensuring we customize our platform to smaller menus. At Pinetree Country Club, we managed to reduce average order times by 40%, which significantly improved the golfer experience.

Ready to discuss how Swoop might work at [FacilityName]? I’d be happy to walk you through our approach in a short call.

Cheers,
Ty
