Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], I wanted to show you how Swoop Golf’s simplified platform can elevate the experience at [FacilityName]—even with minimal food-prep capabilities. By coordinating beverage cart deliveries, light snack options, and to-go items, we keep golfers satisfied without overextending your staff.

At Pinetree Country Club, our solution resulted in a 54% F&B revenue spike and a 40% reduction in wait times. Industry reports show that digital ordering can boost ancillary revenue by 20–40%. It could make a meaningful difference to your bottom line—even if your offerings are limited.

Would a quick 10-minute call on Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work to discuss? If not, I’m happy to find another time.

Cheers,
Ty
