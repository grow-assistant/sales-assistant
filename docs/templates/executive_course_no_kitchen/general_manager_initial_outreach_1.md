Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], I wanted to share how Swoop Golf’s ordering platform simplifies operations at executive courses that lack a full kitchen. With beverage cart deliveries, snack-bar items, and minimal prep needs, we streamline F&B so you can focus on a smooth guest experience.

We’re inviting 2–3 operations to join us at no cost for 2025. At Pinetree Country Club, we boosted F&B revenue by 54% and cut wait times by 40%. We think [FacilityName] could see similar gains, even with limited kitchen capabilities.

Would a 10-minute call on Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work to explore this further? If not, feel free to suggest another time.

Cheers,
Ty
