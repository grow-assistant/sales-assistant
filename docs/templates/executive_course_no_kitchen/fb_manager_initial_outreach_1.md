Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf can act as a complete ordering hub—covering beverage cart requests, quick snack-bar items, and to-go orders. We understand an executive course may only have basic food prep or self-service options, which is why our streamlined platform is ideal for smaller menus.

We’re inviting 2–3 courses like yours to partner with us at no cost in 2025. One of our partners, Pinetree Country Club, experienced a 54% boost in F&B revenue simply by making orders more accessible throughout the round.

If you’re open to a quick conversation, I’d love to see if [FacilityName] could achieve a similar outcome. Feel free to let me know a good time to connect.

Cheers,
Ty
