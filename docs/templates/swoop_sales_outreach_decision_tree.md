# Swoop Golf: Comprehensive Outreach & Decision Tree

## Overview
This document outlines a complete mapping of the internal sales outreach process, incorporating:
- **Lead background** (club details, geography, primary season).  
- **Prior interactions** (emails, calls).  
- **Mailchimp engagement** (opens, clicks, most-viewed campaigns).  
- **Response scenarios** (prompt replies, irregular replies, or no response).

Following these steps will help your team systematically gather intelligence and create a timely, personalized approach to convert leads into active partners.

## 7. Reflective Questions

- Are we aligning outreach times with when they open Mailchimp emails?  
- Are we emphasizing the clicked content that interests them most?  
- What metrics (open rates, call booking rates) can we track to continually refine this process?  

---

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Assign Roles**: Who checks Mailchimp data vs. who preps research?  
2. **Customize Templates**: Reference top-engaged content from prior emails.  
3. **Set CRM Reminders**: Day 0, Day 3, Day 7, Day 10, Day 14.  
4. **Monitor & Iterate**: Evaluate outcomes and optimize.
