Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf’s platform is designed to handle the unique challenges of a 36+ hole facility—from coordinating beverage carts across multiple courses to organizing snack-bar orders and to-go pickups. By consolidating everything, we help you reduce operational bottlenecks, even when player traffic is split across two or more layouts.

One of our partners, Pinetree Country Club, saw a 40% decrease in average order times. Let’s schedule a short call to explore how Swoop could elevate F&B operations at [FacilityName]. What does your availability look like next week?

Cheers,
Ty
