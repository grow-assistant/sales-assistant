Hi [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf is a full on-course ordering platform designed for multi-course facilities—managing everything from beverage cart deliveries to snack-bar requests and to-go pickups across 36+ holes. Our priority is to maintain efficient, hassle-free play across all layouts.

We’re inviting 2–3 facilities to join us at no cost for 2025, ensuring we tailor the platform to your dual or triple-course setup. For example, at Pinetree Country Club, we cut average order times by 40%, improving the overall golfer experience and keeping rounds on schedule.

Interested in a quick chat on how this could work for [FacilityName]? We’d love to discuss how Swoop can support your multi-course operations.

Cheers,
Ty
