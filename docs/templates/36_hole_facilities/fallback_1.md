Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf has evolved beyond a simple golf service into a platform that can handle F&B requests across all 36+ holes at your facility—covering on-course deliveries, snack-bar orders, and to-go pickups. Our mission is to keep multiple courses running smoothly without sacrificing speed of play or guest satisfaction.

We’re inviting 2–3 large facilities to join us at no cost for 2025, ensuring our platform fully addresses multi-course operations. For instance, at Pinetree Country Club, we reduced average order times by 40%, boosting overall satisfaction and easing congestion.

Interested in a short call about how this could work for [FacilityName]? We’d love to show you how Swoop can help streamline day-to-day operations across both (or all) of your courses.

Cheers,
Ty
