Hi [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], Swoop Golf now accommodates facilities with multiple courses—coordinating beverage carts, snack-bar orders, and to-go requests to keep your 36+ holes running without a hitch. Our goal is to minimize downtime and maximize convenience for players, regardless of which course they’re on.

We’re offering 2–3 large facilities a no-cost partnership for 2025, letting us fine-tune our platform to your specific needs. For example, at Pinetree Country Club, we reduced average order times by 40%, maintaining smooth rounds all day.

Would you be open to a quick chat about how Swoop might streamline operations at [FacilityName]? I’d be glad to share more details.

Cheers,
Ty
