Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

[SEASON_VARIATION], I wanted to share how Swoop Golf’s on-course ordering platform can streamline [FacilityName]’s operations across your multiple 18-hole courses. We centralize beverage cart deliveries, snack-bar orders, and to-go pickups, reducing staff strain even when both (or all) courses are busy.

We’re inviting 2–3 large facilities to partner with us at no cost for 2025. At Pinetree Country Club, we lifted F&B revenue by 54% and decreased wait times by 40%. We think [FacilityName] could see comparable gains.

Would a 10-minute call on Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work to explore this further? If not, feel free to suggest another time.

Cheers,
Ty
