A New Way to Boost F&B at [ClubName]—No Extra Staff Needed

## Body
Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

{SEASON_VARIATION} Swoop Golf can act as a full club concierge, covering not just on-course ordering but also poolside service and streamlined to-go operations. We designed it to help you and your team serve members quickly and conveniently—without juggling multiple systems.

We're looking for 2–3 clubs to partner with in 2025 at no cost. One of our current partners, Pinetree Country Club, saw a 54% boost in F&B revenue by making orders simple and accessible for members.

If you're open to a quick chat, I'd love to see if [ClubName] could benefit in the same way. Feel free to let me know a good time to connect, and I can share references or more details tailored to your needs.

Cheers,
Ty
