A New Way to Boost F&B at [Club Name]—No Extra Staff Needed

## Body
Hey [FirstName],

[ICEBREAKER]

{SEASON_VARIATION} Swoop Golf has become a full club concierge, covering not just on-course ordering, but also poolside service and streamlined to-go operations. This model dramatically reduces bottlenecks and helps clubs serve members quickly and conveniently.

We’re looking for 2–3 clubs to partner with in 2025 at no cost. One of our existing partners, Pinetree Country Club, reported a 54% increase in F&B revenue under this approach by making orders incredibly easy for members.

If you’re open to a short conversation, I’d love to see if [Club Name] could benefit similarly. I can also share references from clubs currently using Swoop.

Cheers,
Ty
